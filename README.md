Prototypal inheritance algorithm supporting traits & dependency injection.

## Very alpha (and broken, lots of changes coming!)

please wait for the first release!

## Features

- ~~Fast!~~ 
- ~~Fully tested~~
- ~~Fully documented~~
- Supports amd, node, globals, es6 modules
- ~~ES6 & ES5 binaries (as well as intermediate version)~~
- Made with bits of love!

## Installation

[bower](http://bower.io)

`bower install cell-type`

[npm](https://www.npmjs.com)

`npm install cell-type`

## Usage

```js
/* coming soon */
```

For more usage example see the unit tests @ /test/unit/Type-spec.js

## Prototypal(OLOO) vs 'Classical' inheritance

By default prototypal(OLOO) inheritance is supported. Practically this means that the default export will be the Type prototype. Also all static properties will be directly available on the prototype (as well as on the constructor function). If you prefer 'classical' inheritance a CType export is also provided.

## Documentation

Documentation can be generated by running the command below and is outputted @ /doc.

`npm run docs`

Make sure you'll run a npm install first.
