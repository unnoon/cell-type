Prototypal(OLOO) inheritance algorithm.

## Features

- Fully tested
- Fully documented
- OLOO ready
- Static & getter/setter inheritance
- Dynamic prototype & property swapping
- Supports symbols
- Validations for overrides, static this usage, illegal private usage
- Supports attributes! i.e. frozen, static, const etc.
- Supports amd, node, globals, es6 modules
- ES6 & ES5 binaries (as well as intermediate version)
- Made with bits of love!

## Installation

[bower](http://bower.io)

`bower install cell-type`

[npm](https://www.npmjs.com)

`npm install cell-type`

## Usage

```js
/* coming soon */
```

For more usage example see the unit tests @ /test/unit/Type-spec.js

## Prototypal(OLOO) inheritance

By default prototypal(OLOO) inheritance is supported. Practically this means that types('classes') created by Type will just be simple objects that can be used as a prototype. In general I like to avoid any class related jargon. Therefore this._upper (instead of this._super) can be used to access a property higher up in the prototype chain. Statics will be directly available on the prototype. Static properties will be wrapped in a getter/setter so the value can be changed from this. 

## Documentation

Documentation can be generated by running the command below and is outputted @ /doc.

## Future work

- Traits (coming up in the near future)
- State properties
- Dependency injection (in some form or another)

`npm run docs`

Make sure you'll run a npm install first.
